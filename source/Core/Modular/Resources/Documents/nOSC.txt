NODES




PROPERTIES

A node may have properties in addition to containing other nodes.
These properties are themselves addressed using the same slash syntax as is used for the nodes themselves.
Properties are accessed using the : character as proposed in the NIME08 paper.



QUERIES

A query is a two-part dialog, consisting of a request and a response.
The address path of a query ends with the ? character:
	* The request is simply the address path ending with the ? character
	* The response is the same address path (ending with the ? character), but with additional data following the address path.

When returning a value(s), the response must be returned using JSON.

									"value" : "foo",

									"type" : "symbol",
									"ramp" : {
										"drive" : {
