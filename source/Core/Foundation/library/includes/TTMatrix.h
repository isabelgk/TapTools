	/**	You must proceed to set the various attributes, dimensions, etc. to match the data format of the matrix you are referencing.
	 
		One caveat regards data alignment.  Jitter, for example, aligns rows on 16-byte boundaries.
		In this case, a 4x10 matrix (using the m-by-n convention rather than Jitter's width-by-height convention) of 32-bit ints,
		all with a value of "4" will look like this:

		4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 0, 0
		4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 0, 0
		4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 0, 0
		4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 4, 4,   4, 4, 0, 0

		Thus, the rows are really of a dimension length 12 instead of 10 and the total size of the matrix scales as well.

		For the time being, we do not handle this case.
		Jitter users must dimension their matrices so that the row size in bytes is a multiple of 16.
		This is not actually hard to do for most purposes.  For example:

		float64, element count of 1, width is a multiple of 2 (an even number)
		float32 or int32, element count of 1, width is a multiple of 4
		uint8, element count of 1, width is a multiple of 16 (which includes 80, 160, 320, 640, ...), but
		element count of 4 (i.e. color pixels) width should be a multiple of values.
