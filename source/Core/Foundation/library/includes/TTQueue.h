	The old TTQueue class (circa 2008) was unused, and was designed specificaly to be used only for getting things
	from an other thread onto the main thread.
 
	The new TTQueue class is more general, and is designed as a non-blocking circular buffer for getting
	events from thread A to thread B where the neither of the threads are required to be the main thread.
 
	A specific use of this queue to get things to the main thread can be created and would then use this
	newer version of the class.

/**
	The TTQueue class implements a non-blocking circular queue for passing events across threads.
	The items in the queue are TTValues.
	What is contained in the TTValue will be specific to whatever is using the queue.
 
	This is based on "Efficient Adaptations of Non-Blocking Buffer for Event Message Communication
	between Real-Time Threads" by Kim, Colmenares, and Rim from the proceedings of the 10th IEEE
	International Symposium on Object and Component-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing.
 
	One important difference is that we copy data at both the insert() and the read(), rather than 
	referencing a pointer at insert() and copying only at read().
	The reason for this is that we could easily put something on the queue (i.e. a reference to an object)
	that is temporary (alloc'd on the stack, for example) and then disappears prior to being serviced.
 

	There are other implementations of a lock-free queue/FIFO that should be referenced:
 
 
	1. PortAudio (pa_ringbuffer.h/.c) does things a little bit differently, for example.
	Similar to what we have done, the memory for the items in the buffer is owned by the buffer.
	The counters are not implemented with OS-level atomic operations, but the reads and writes 
	into the buffer are done using OS-level memory barriers.
	Question: Because of our use of the atomic operations on the counters, do we still need to use memory barriers?
	Reference: http://www.rossbencina.com/code/lockfree

 
	2. SuperCollider is more like a hybrid of the PortAudio approach and the NBB implementation 
	on which this class is currently based.  The implementation can be found in common/Headers/server/MsgFifo.h.
	One cool thing is that it uses a template class in C++ so that the queue could hold any type of items, rather than
	restricted to a type or even a container like we do with TTValue.
 
	TODO: we should do this template thing like SC
	
	SC does not have the busy/retry ability that we have, but it also might be quicker because there is only one
	atomic increment at write instead of two.  
	Instead of using an atomic increment, however, it is using OSAtomicCompareAndSwap32Barrier -- apparently for legacy reasons.
 
	Additionally it does in enforce a memory barrier on the Mac by issuing __sync_synchronize() in the 
	equivalents of both insert() and read().
 
	Unlike NBB, based on a first reading of the code, it looks like it uses shared references rather than copying by value.
	It looks like this is true for *both* read (perform) and insert (write), which means that the heap usage is not
	kept isolated as argued to be the most important factor in the NBB paper.
