Jamoma Foundation
Reflective C++ API and Runtime
_________________________________________________________________


To make using Boost as painless as possible in Jamoma, we are including it the Jamoma Foundation.  The whole Boost library, however, is quite large and so there are some caveats.

1. We are not keeping the docs under version control, they can found online.
2. We are not keeping the tools under version control, you can download them separately if you need them.

Even so, we are adding 130 MB to the repository (ouch).  The benefits should out-weight the downside though, even if we only used the Regex library.

We, in general, have a couple of ideals to hold up while writing the code in the Foundation.

+ It's okay for the code look funny, have template syntax, etc. inside the library.  However, it is not okay to impose this syntax on people writing subclassed of TTObject.  They should be unencumbered as much as possible.

+ All use of third-party software (which includes Boost) should be wrapped inside of classes and function -- not exported directly.  This gives us the ability to change our internals at will without forcing a recompile by all software linking to us.  It also allows us to deal with platforms not supporting the third-party library (on embedded systems, for example).
