@inproceedings{Peters:2012testing,
	Abstract = {Software development benefits from systematic testing with respect to implementation, optimization, and maintenance. Automated testing makes it easy to execute a large number of tests efficiently on a regular basis, leading to faster development and more reliable software.
Systematic testing is not widely adopted within the computer music community, where software patches tend to be continuously modified and optimized during a project. Consequently, bugs are often discovered during rehearsal or performance, resulting in literal ?show stoppers?. This paper presents a testing environment for computer music systems, first developed for the Jamoma framework and Max. The testing environment works with Max 5 and 6, is independ from any 3rd-party objects, and can be used with non-Jamoma patches as well.},

@inproceedings{Place2010:DSP,
	Abstract = {This paper presents an object-oriented, reflective, ap- plication framework for C++, with an emphasis on real- time signal processing. The Jamoma Foundation and DSP Library provide a runtime environment and an expand- ing collection of unit generators for synthesis, processing, and analysis. It makes use of polymorphic typing, dy- namic binding, and introspection to create a cross-platform API pulling ideas from languages such as Smalltalk and Objective-C while remaining within the bounds of the portable and cross-platform C++ context. Over the past sev- eral years this library has been used in both open source and commercial software projects in the sound and music com- puting field.},
