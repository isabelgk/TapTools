 * @n
 * This window is intended for microsound applications as described by Roads (2001 p 88-90).
 * Ratio variable allows this single class to produce BOTH expodec and rexpodec windows with options between.
 * Lambda variable is set so that the quietest point in the decay will be -60 dB.
 * @n
 * Where 0. <= x <= 1. and 0. <= mRatio <= 1.: @n
 * y = e^ ( ( 1 - ( x / mRatio ) ) * lambda )        : for the attack (approaching peak) @n
 * 	 = e^ ( ((x - mRatio) / (1 - mRatio)) * lambda ) : for the release (leaving peak)
