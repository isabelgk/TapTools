 y = 1.0 @n
 * @n
 * It is the same as the Matlab function: @n
 * w=rectwin(L) @n
 * Which is an alias for: @n
 * w = ones(L,1); @n
 * http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/signal/ref/rectwin.html @n
 * @n
 * This can be expressed also as: @n
 * w(n) = 1, 0 <= n <= N-1 @n
 * @n
 * Values outside of this range could be set to zero, though (at least in theory)
 * we should never receive a request for out-of-range values. @n
